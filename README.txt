In order to run the code, all files should be in the same project (environment). Moreover, the name of the dataset folder given named "valid" should be changed to "train" before running any code.

-utils.py contains helper functions used in the other files
-svm_with_hog.py is used to train and test the classical method model
-ResNet-18.py is used to train and test the deep learning method model
-save_perturbations.py is used to save all perturbed images in a directory (time consuming). Follow instructions in comments in the file and should be runned before plot_graphs.py
-plot_graphs.py is used to run the robustness exploration experiment and plot the graphs found in the report.

Thank you.
